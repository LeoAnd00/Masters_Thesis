**cell_type_annotation_loss_comp:** Contains code for visualizing the comparison between different loss functions.
1. Code for training the model on the different loss functions can be found in the *Alvis_cluster_code* repo.
2. Move resulting folder for each dataset containing .csv files into the */cell_type_annotation_loss_comp* path in the *main* repo.
3. Run *Calc_metrics.ipynb* to concatenate all cell type annotation results into */results_and_visualizations*
4. Run *visualize_metrics.ipynb* to make visualizations.
