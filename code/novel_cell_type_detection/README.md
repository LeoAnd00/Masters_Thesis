# novel_cell_type_detection
Contains all code used in this project for evaluating novel cell type prediction ability.

## How to run
In *benchmark_annotation.py* the commands needed to run the novel cell type detection can be found as a comment. <br> 
in this code we calculate metrics on the novel cell type, and all other cell types separately. <br>
In *benchmark_annotation2.py* the commands needed to run the novel cell type detection can be found as a comment. <br>  
in this code we calculate metrics on the models novel predictions, and on non-novel predictions separately.
