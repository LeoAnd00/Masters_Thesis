# functions
Code for data preprocessing, training models and producing cell type vector representations from latent space representations.

## Structur
- **data_preprocessing.py:** Functions for perfroming different data processing.
- **train.py:** Code for training the machine learning models where all data is used for both validation and training.
- **train_with_validation.py:** Code for training the machine learning models, but where 20% of the data is used for validation and 80% for training.
