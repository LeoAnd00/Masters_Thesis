# Learning Meaningful Representations of Cells - a Master's Thesis

**Abstract**
<br>
Batch effects are a significant concern in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data analysis, where variations in the data can be attributed to factors unrelated to cell types. This can make downstream analysis a challenging task. In this study, a neural network model is designed utilizing contrastive learning and a novel loss function for generating an embedding space from scRNA-Seq data. When benchmarked against multiple established methods on scRNA-Seq integration, the model outperformed existing methods on creating a generalizable embedding space. A downstream application that was investigated for the embedding space was cell type annotation. When compared against multiple well established cell type classifiers the model in this study displayed a performance competitive with top performing methods across multiple metrics, such as accuracy, balanced accuracy and F1 score. These findings motivates the meaningfulness contained within the generated embedding space by the model, highlighting its potential applications.
