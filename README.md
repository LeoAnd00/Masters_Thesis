# Learning Meaningful Representations of Cells - a Master's Thesis

**Intorduction**
<br>
Cells in our body exhibit remarkable diversity, and characterizing and classifying differ-
ent cell types is fundamental to understanding their functions and contributions to various
biological processes. Learning meaningful representations of cell types enable us to or-
ganize and categorize cells based on their shared characteristics, such as gene expression
patterns or phenotypic features. Due to its far-reaching implications in the biomedical
sciences, including disease diagnostics and drug development, learning meaningful rep-
resentations of cell types is an active area of research in deep learning, and something
which was an active topic of discussion at the recent Learning Meaningful Representa-
tions of Life (LMRL) workshop at NeurIPS 2022. These representations enable us to
better comprehend cellular similarities, identify disease-specific cell populations, and de-
sign targeted therapies conditioned on the relevant cell-type.

To learn a meaningful representation of cells, this project aims to utilize single-cell omics
(sc-omics) data combined with cell image data to train a multi-modal neural network to
produce an efficient, lower-dimensional latent representation of cell types.
